## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
The purpose of this project is to build an e-commerce REST API using our knowledge of server side development.

This project required that I build a fully-functioning e-commerce application REST API that allows users to perform various CRUD operations such as registering an account, browsing products for sale, etc.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
Before anything remember to install all the dependencies using

```
npm install
```

### Opening the App and Testing Suite

First you will need to get the server and the React App up and running. These are set to open simultaneously as per the npm concurrently package. 

```
npm run dev
```

Then to get Cypress testing suite running you will need to run

```
npx cypress open
```

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Example end to end tests
This is an end-to-end test describing the process of a new user creating a new login and adding their credentials, if unique, to the databse. This is a great test to implement as it tests the flow of a user on the happy path, also known as the path which results in a positive result, not only engaging with the front end, but sending a POST request to the server and entering their unique credentials into the databse. This is an excellent test to see if the backend and frontend are working correctly. 

```
describe('Operations on user accounts', () => {
  it('Register for account', () => {
    cy.visit('http://localhost:3000')

    cy.get("[data-test='accounts-image']")
      .should('be.visible')

    cy.get('[data-test="accounts-image"]')
      .click();

    cy.get('[data-test="login"]')
      .contains('No account? Register here');

    cy.get('[data-test="no-account"]')
      .click();

    cy.get("[data-test='register']")
      .contains('Register')

    cy.get('[data-test="email"]')
      .type('JohnDoe@JDmail.com');

    cy.get('[data-test="password"]')
      .type('123456');

    cy.get('[data-test="confirmpassword"]')
      .type('123456');
    
    cy.get('[data-test="register-button"]')
      .click();
    
    cy.get('[data-test="login"]')
      .contains('Welcome');
  })
})
```

### And component tests
These tests test the functionality of the components and the functionality surrounding the happy path. These may also test the "sad paths" also known as the cases where the registration was not able to be completed. Completion of the regisstration can be halted to due to a variety of factors such as incorrect format of email addresses, non-matching passwords or trying to register with an email that already exists.

```
describe('Register button functionality', () => {
    beforeEach(() => {
        cy.viewport(1920, 1080)
        cy.mount(<Router>
                    <Register />
                </Router>)
    })
    it('Register button sends user info', () => {
        cy.request({
            method: 'POST',
            url: 'http://localhost:5000/api/profile',
            body: {
                email: 'JohnDoe@jdmail.com',
                password: '123456',
                confirmPassword: '123456'
            }
        }).then( profile => {
            expect(profile.status).to.eq(200)
        })
    })
  })
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
Feel free to click through the e-commerce store like you would any online shop. As of now the functionality is limited to registering your user credentials to the databse and looking at products from the main page.

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>
I am aiming to deploy this API on Heroku.
